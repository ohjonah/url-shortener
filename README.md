# URL Shortener with Node.js, Express, MongoDB

This app uses Bootstrap 4 and EJS to serve a Node/Express Url Shortening service using MongoDB as the backend. The tutorial can be referenced [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLpUKAGnm-g&t=1s).

Start by running `npm i` followed by `npm start`.
This will start this service on Port 3000 or whatever you have set your .env `PORT` value to.
